# meanstarterkit
A Mean Stack Starter kit with passport js login authentication

I orginally created this kit to quickly create a mean stack web app to quickly launch an application that supports login so I can quickly focus on the main features of the web app. Open sourcing if is of use to anyone else or if anyone wants to learn from it.

Usage:

1) git clone https://github.com/Danish21/meanstarterkit.git localfoldername

2) cd localfoldername

3) npm install

4) cd web 

5) bower install

6) Enjoy!
